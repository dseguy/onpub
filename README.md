Onpub
=====

Introduction
------------
Onpub is a web content management system (CMS) designed for those with intermediate to advanced web development skills wanting to create custom, dynamic websites that are easy to update and maintain.

All Onpub content is stored in a fast and reliable MySQL database backend. There are many ways to customize and extend Onpub's default design and functionality via open-standard web development tools and techniques.

Onpub is ideal for those with no desire to implement a CMS from scratch, but still need a custom, yet agile solution. Onpub tightly integrates many widely used third-party web apps and scripts in to one coherent system to build further upon.

Onpub was written by Corey Taylor in Boston, MA. Corey is still the sole author and maintainer of the source code.
