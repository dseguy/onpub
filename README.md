Onpub
=====

Introduction
------------
Onpub is a web content management system (CMS) designed for those with intermediate to advanced web development skills wanting to create custom, dynamic websites that are easy to update and maintain.

All Onpub content is stored in a fast and reliable MySQL database backend. There are many ways to customize and extend Onpub's default design and functionality via open-standard web development tools and techniques.

Onpub is ideal for those with no desire to implement a CMS from scratch, but still need a custom, yet agile solution. Onpub tightly integrates many widely used third-party web apps and scripts in to one coherent system to build further upon.

Onpub was written by Corey Taylor in Boston, MA. Corey is still the sole author and maintainer of the source code.

Key Features
------------ 
### Mobile device and touch-screen friendly

Onpub uses responsive web design techniques in order to automatically adapt its frontend layout to smaller screens, such as those on modern smartphones. No re-directs or separate mobile micro sites required.

### Fully customizable frontend

Every Onpub download includes a frontend template that can be fully customized to suit your needs. This customization is done via a combination of CSS, PHP, and JavaScript code changes. All code is fully web-standards compliant and open source.

### YUI integration

The frontend interface tightly integrates the Yahoo User Interface (YUI) JavaScript and CSS libraries, making it easy to write cross-browser compatible HTML markup and DHTML JavaScript code.

### Cross-browser compatible

Onpub supports all YUI Target Environments. This means that the sites you build with Onpub will have a high level of compatibility with all modern web browsers. Your site will look and behave exactly the same way, regardless of whether you are viewing it in IE, Chrome, or Firefox. This includes modern mobile browsers as well.

### Easy HTML editing

The content management interface tightly integrates the widely used HTML editor, CKEditor. CKEditor enables both "what you see is what you get" HTML editing, and also HTML and JavaScript source code editing all within one easy to use, word processor-like interface.

### Quick content updates

Onpub extends CKEditor to make it even easier to use by enabling AJAX -based saving, so that updating your content does not require a full page reload. This allows you to save your changes without losing your cursor position. This also allows you to easily undo unwanted changes and then re-save.

### Unsaved change detection

When editing your articles with Onpub, you will be warned of unsaved changes if you attempt to navigate away from the page before saving your changes. This feature makes it much less likely that you'll ever lose data due to accidental mouse clicks.

### Simple account management

Your MySQL user account is your Onpub login. There's no need to setup a separate user account to start using Onpub to build sites. Also, you can connect to any database that your MySQL account has access to, making it easy to work with multiple content databases within one login session.

### Free and open-source software

Onpub is licensed under version 2 of the GNU GPL. This means you are free to re-distribute all original source code changes, so long as you contribute any improvements to the application back to us. Onpub is developed openly via its GitHub project page.
